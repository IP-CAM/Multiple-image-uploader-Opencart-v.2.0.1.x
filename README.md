# opencart-multiple-image-uploader
OpenCart v2.0.1.1 multiple image uploader based on DropZone.js
* Because it's based on DropZone.js (http://www.dropzonejs.com) it supports drag and drop.
* Intuitive and easy to use.
* Integrated with OC image manager, you can activate it clicking on a new button: MULTIPLE IMAGE UPLOADER on the right side of image manager.
* This is not an extension or module, this is a core modification (I just taked a pair of hours to complete this project) so before installation get a backup of your installation.
